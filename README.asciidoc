If information about openQA is what you seek, come no further as this is the
place you were looking for.

Here we collect https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA[openQA], https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst[os-autoinst] and related documentation, tips and
presentations.

The project's information is organized into four basic documents. As a first
step, read the link:docs/GettingStarted.asciidoc[Starter Guide] and then, if
needed, proceed to the link:docs/Installing.asciidoc[Installation Guide].

If you are interested in development, check the 
link:docs/Contributing.asciidoc[Developer Guide] or the
link:docs/WritingTests.asciidoc[Tests Developer Guide], write your code and
send a pull request ;-)
